# Walnut

A design system for the surfaces of testing softwares.

## System values

### It is discreet

Let the surfaces fade away to allow work to happen.

### It is native

Let the surfaces be familiar to where work happens.

### It is accessible

Let the surfaces honor accepted standards so everyone can use them.

### It is specialized

Let the surfaces be appropriate for the job to be done. Favor consistency over novelty, but not at the cost of functionality.

## Getting started
